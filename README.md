## Architecture

## Modules & Packages

The following "core" modules comprise the initial release of the Baseline protocol:

| Package | Source Path | Description |
| -------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `@baseline-protocol/api` | `core/api` | Core *baseline* API package providing unified access to the `baseline` JSON-RPC module and blockchain, registry and key management interfaces |
| `@baseline-protocol/contracts` | `core/contracts` | Solidity contracts packaged as a Truffle project; includes ERC1820/organization registry |
| `@baseline-protocol/messaging` | `core/messaging` | Core messaging package with protocol-agnostic p2p interface with NATS and Whisper implementations |
| `@baseline-protocol/persistence` | `core/persistence` | Persistence package; this is a placeholder for system of record integration standards (see ERP connector projects under `examples/`) |
| `@baseline-protocol/privacy` | `core/privacy` | Core privacy package initially exposing a zkSnark circuit provider factory; designed to support future privacy implementations |
| `@baseline-protocol/types` | `core/types` | Core reuseable type definitions; also provides a convenience wrapper around interacting with `lib/` assets (i.e. circuits) |

Implementing a minimum set of these `core` packages will help you maintain *baseline-compliance* as the protocol evolves and standards emerge. As of the initial `core` release, depending on the `api`, `messaging` and `privacy` packages should be considered the most minimalistic approach to implementing the protocol, provided that your organization is participating in a workgroup that has deployed the `contracts` artifacts. A reference implementation and end-to-end test suite featuring Alice and Bob is being maintained under [`examples/baseline-app`](examples/baseline-app).
